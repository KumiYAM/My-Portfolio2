# My-Portfolio
This is my bootcamp portfolio.
A basic HTML and external CSS sheet.
Most challenging part was apply and refrect CSS to HTML structure.

Secondly challenging part is to insert images.

My own trial was to creat mobile-flex version. (it is not requiemant for this assigmnet.)

I would like to keep working on this repositpry till I master.
